Hammer Network - 1.0 - README file
----------------------------------

- About

Hammer Network is an application writen in Qt 4.8. It's main purpose in this
planet is to make the usage of WonderShaper a little bit less difficult for
the users.

   WonderShaper is a GNU/Linux command line tool to control the network
speed usage. Some advantages of WonderShaper over other tools are:

   - "On the fly" control. There is no need to reboot the system or to restart
     an application.
   - Easy sintax. Interface name, upload and download speeds, and thats it.
   
Some bad sides of WonderShaper:

   - Can't control individual applications. The speed control is for the whole
     system.
   - Requires the root password. Run as root.
   - The network speed control is not exact. The speed will be from -10 to +10
     kilobytes from the speed specified.
   
Hammer Network attempts to create an interface to the user to simplify the
usage of WonderShaper. The interface detects the current network interfaces and
display some basic information.

   The application asks for the root password using KDESU, but such behavior is
configurable, since the root runner can be changed, and even the option to run
with a root runner at all (for the cases of making WonderShaper accessible for
the normal users, or if Hammer Network is run as root).

   The program stores per-user configuration. Has two available languages (english
and spanish), and cam be configured a lot.



- Compile and install

Hammer Network needs to be compiled and can be installed. To compile it, the user
can use these commands (as normal users):

   $ qmake
   $ make
   
   The Qt project file is already configured as needed. The "qmake" command will expand
any needed folder and prepare some Makefile files according to your system. The
command "make" will compile the program. The final file must be a binary file, called
"hammernetwork".

   The user, if it wants, can use a script called "compile.sh". Such file is a Bash
script. It will run the previous two commands.

   To install the program, the user can use a script file named "install.sh". Such file
must be executed as root:

   # ./install.sh
   
The script will copy the binary file to /usr/bin, the menu entry file to /usr/share/applications/,
and the application icon to /usr/share/icons/.

   To perform a manual installation, copy the file resources/menus/hammer-network.desktop to
/usr/share/applications/, the file resources/img/icon/main-128x128.png to /usr/share/icons/
as "hammer-network.png", and the file "hammernetwork" (the binary file) to /usr/bin/.




- Uninstall

To uninstall Hammer Network, just remove the three files specified in the previous section.
